# CS-210

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
When supplied with a list of recent product purchases, this project allows the user to analyze the frequency in which each product sold.

# What did you do particularly well?
While I'm sure there is much that I could improve on, I think I did a good job of keeping the project simple but functional.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
While the code used in my project does have input validation for the menu, there is no input validation to ensure that the input file is in the correct configuration which could lead to issues. While beyond the scope of the project, it might have been useful to implement a way to sort the list of products by the frequency in which they were sold instead of the input order. I think I did a decent job but that's based on my current level of knowledge. If I were more knowledgable about programming and C++, there might be ways in which my code is ineffficient or insecure.

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
I struggled the most with finding a way to iterate through the map containing the product names and frequency of sale. I utilized a C++ reference website (https://en.cppreference.com/) heavily to learn more about how specific things in C++ worked.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
I don't think I learned a ton of new skills with this project, however it reinforced concepts that I'd previously learned about elsewhere that I was not very confident in.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
This program was made maintainable, readable, and adaptable through the use of functions, concise but meaningful variable names, detailed comments, and keeping the program relatively simply.
